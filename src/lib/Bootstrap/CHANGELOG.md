# 1.3.3
* Better controls for UI layout regions.

# 1.3.2
* Automatic density for molecular surfaces.
* Automatic maximum detail level for balls and sticks and cartoons for small molecules.
* Applying laplacian smoothing to density surfaces now uses weighting to better preserve "small density blobs".

  - Tasks are not created by providing a computation object or a Promise and their context object 
    is the same as as the uderlaying Computation's one.

# 1.2.7
* Fixed Transform UI state issue.

# 1.2.6
* Updated Transformer.action to provide option "onError" message and support actions returned as a promise.
* Updated Tree.Selection.byRef/byValue to accept multiple arguments. 
* Added Transform.actionWithContext.
* Added Entity.Transformer.Basic.Fail.
* Support for title in Data.Download transform.

# 1.2.5
* Density behavior updates.

# 1.2.4

# 1.2.2
* Added support for popup messages (toasts).
* Added the option to disable fog on per visual basis.
* Fog no longer affects selected residue, ambience, and dynamic density data.
* Ability to better control layout regions.
* Persistent state for transformer controllers.

# 1.2.1
* Transform builder no longer requires verbose type annotations that were sometimes required.

# 1.2.0
* Changed how visual interactivity works.
* Modified how ShowInteractionOnSelect behavior works (clicking an ambient residue now moves the selection).
* BREAKING CHANGE: Command.Molecule.CreateSelectInteraction now takes the parameters { entity, query } instead of { visual, query }.

# 1.1.8
* Added the ability to decompress Gzip from binary ajax response.
* Support for specifying absolute iso values for density data. (BREAKING CHANGE: Instead of isoSigma, isoValue and isoValueType properties are now used).

# 1.1.7
* Fixed molecule highlight info to show authAsymId instead of asymId for highlighted residues.  

# 1.1.6
* Added Data.FromData transformer.

# 1.1.5
* Bugfix in CreateSelectInteraction command.

# 1.1.4
* Added rainbow coloring.
* Coordinate Streaming now uses BinaryCIF.

# 1.1.3
* Updated to match Core version 2.4.
* Entity.Transformer.Molecule.CreateFromString => Entity.Transformer.Molecule.CreateFromData
* Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseBinary => Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseString

# 1.1.2
* Fixed a bug where updating molecule visual coloring led to mutating the default theme.

# 1.1.1
* Fix in selecting the next entity when the current one is removed.

# 1.1.0
* Added more parsing transforms for molecules (CreateFromString) and density (CreateFromBinary)
* Renamed Entity.Transformer.Molecule.CreateFromCif to Entity.Transformer.Molecule.CreateFromMmCif
* Updated Entity.Transformer.Molecule.downloadMoleculeSource to support multiple formats.
* Updated Entity.Transformer.Molecule.OpenCifMoleculeFromFile to Entity.Transformer.Molecule.OpenMoleculeFromFile and added support for multiple file formats.
* LiteMol.Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseCcp4 and LiteMol.Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseBrix merged into LiteMol.Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseBinary

# 1.0.12
* Fixes to Plugin fullscreen mode when body max dimensions were altered.

# 1.0.11
* SetVisibility command now checks for undefined entity.

# 1.0.10
* "Fixed" Int32Array.forEach because IE and Safari do not support it. 

# 1.0.9
* Added interfaces for plugin definition.

# 1.0.8
* Added "UnselectElementOnRepeatedClick" behaviour.
