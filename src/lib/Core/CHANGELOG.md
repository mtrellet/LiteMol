# 3.0.0
* Updated Molecule representation.
  - Changed namespaces for MoleculeModel to Molecule.Model
  - Molecule.Model:
    - atoms/residues/chains/... are now accessed as data.atoms/...
    - positions are now a separate table and no longer part of atoms. 
    - these changes are to enable better data sharing between different models of the same molecule

* Added Core.Utils.FastMap/FastSet
  - This replaces most ES6 map usage in LiteMol.
